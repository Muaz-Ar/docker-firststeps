# In reality you work with more than one container for one projekt and you must be sure that they can comunicatat to each other 
# let lok at a scebarui where you have a notes-api application powered by ExpressJs and a PostgreSQL database server running in to seperate containers 
# how can we Connect them 
# one way is to accessing the database server using exposed port but that dont will be work 

# with docker network ls you will see the dockernetworks 
# for default docker has 5 kinds of netwerk driver 

# 1 bridge : The default networking driver in Docker. This can be used when multiple containers are running in standard mode and needs to communicate with each other.

# 2 host : Removes the network isolation completely. Any container running under a host network is basically attached to the network of the host system.

# 3 none - This driver disables networking for containers altogether. I haven't' found any use-case for this yet.

# 4 overlay : This is used for connecting multiple Docker daemons across computers and is out of the scope of this article.

# 5 macvlan : Allows assignment of MAC addresses to containers making them function like physical devices in a network.
